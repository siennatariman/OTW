# On the Way (OTW) PH: A Virtual Travelling Assistant Mobile Application
*Group 01 Mobile App for CPE176P created with React Native*

Project On The Way (OTW) PH is a mobile application which seeks to be a go-to commute companion for introvert commuters. There are instances wherein introverted commuters may have trouble in directly asking and communicating with strangers en route to their destination that they are unfamiliar with. In these instances, obtaining commute-related information is detrimental in order to arrive at their destination, since at times these commute-related information is not always provided by web mapping platforms such as Google Maps and Waze (e.g. there are routes or sakayans that only locals of a particular area would know or be aware of). OTW PH minimizes direct communication with strangers in real-life since the application would be the online medium where communication for commute-related information can happen.
